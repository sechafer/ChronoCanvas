A fun way to paint your birthday! Enter a date to see relevant data. Drag and drop components around on the page, paint on the interactive canvas, screenshot or generate a PDf of the day. 
Compare two days with the dual date page to see what similarities and differences there are between two dates. 

Generative AI uses a prompt to generate the data and an SVG that is an abstract representation of the day with a description of why it used those elements in the SVG. 

See backend directory for more data relating to backend work.
