- Chinese zodiac sign
- Chinese zodiac element
- Birth flower (associated with the birth month)
- svg that would be an image of an artistic representation of one or many parts of this data. Do not include any words just an artistic depiction. I should be able to use the svg directly from the json object in my application. be sure not to escape any of the quotes or have n for new lines.
- image description that describes why you made the artistic decisions that you did with the svg.

Use the date "March 15, 1990" as an example and ensure the output is structured as valid JSON.

Example Input: March 15, 1990
Expected Output:

  "zodiac": "Pisces",
  "zodiacSymbol": "Energetic, candid, and willful",
  "chineseZodiac": "Horse",
  "chineseZodiacElement": "Metal",
  "birthFlower": "Daffodil",
  "svg" : "<svg width="800" height="600" viewBox="0 0 800 600" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">  </svg> preserve aspect ratio true"
  "imgDescription" : "This features a calming blue aquamarine gradient background, symbolizing protection, health, and tranquility.

A delicate daffodil, the birth flower, is positioned at the bottom right, symbolizing new beginnings and prosperity. The composition is accented with wave-like patterns to emphasize the fluid nature of Pisces, while the entire design maintains a celestial theme with subtle star elements to connect with astrological symbolism." do not use the word svg in the description.
